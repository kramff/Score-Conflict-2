<title>Score Conflict 2! Welcome to the exciting world of Score Conflict 2! In this game you will experience a conflict about score. Good Luck! This is the second version of Score Conflict, so we will call it "Score Conflict 2". It features finely tuned competitive gameplay like the original Score Conflict, but does not use the Perlinspiel engine. Additionally, Score Conflict 2 has online multiplayer. (Did we decide on if we're doing netplay yet? I'm up for giving it a shot.)</title>
